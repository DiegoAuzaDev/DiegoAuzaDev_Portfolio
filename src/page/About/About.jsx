                Hello! I am Diego Auza, and I am happy to share the projects I
                have been working on. I am a Mobile and Web developer who loves
                learning and getting better at what I do
              </p>
              <p>
                I mainly work on mobile apps using 
                <span className="special--text"> Flutter</span> and
                <span className="special--text"> React Native</span>, and for
                websites, I use 
                <span className="special--text"> HTMl</span>,
                <span className="special--text"> CSS</span>,
 and popular frameworks like React and
                Angular. I also have some experience with backend technologies
                like Firebase, MongoDB, and Redis.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it is not just about tech stuff, I strongly believe that
                being a good developer means having good people skills too. My
                colleagues say I am a team player always ready to help out.
