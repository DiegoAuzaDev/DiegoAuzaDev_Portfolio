              <p>
                Hello! I am Diego Auza, and I am happy to share the projects I
                have been working on. I am a Mobile and Web developer who loves
                learning and getting better at what I do
              </p>
              <p>
                I mainly work on mobile apps using
                <span className="special--text"> Flutter</span> and
                <span className="special--text"> React Native</span>, and for
                websites, I use
                <span className="special--text"> HTMl</span>,
                <span className="special--text"> CSS</span>, and popular
                frameworks like <span className="special--text"> React</span>{" "}
                and
                <span className="special--text"> Angular</span>. I also have
                some experience with backend technologies like
                <span className="special--text"> Firebase</span>,
                <span className="special--text"> MongoDB</span>, and
                <span className="special--text"> Redis</span>.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it is not just about tech stuff, I strongly believe that
                being a good developer means having good people skills too. My
                colleagues say I am a
                <span className="special--text"> team player</span> ready to
                <span className="special--text"> help </span>
                out.
